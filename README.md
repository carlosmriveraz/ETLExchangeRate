ETL Project: Extract, Transform, Load
Description
This project is an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) system developed using the latest versions of Visual Studio and C# with cutting-edge frameworks. The codebase adheres to best practices and emphasizes clean code. We leverage AI-powered tools and LINQ for code optimization. Our documentation is thorough and professional.

The ETL process involves extracting information from compressed ZIP files obtained via an API. Each ZIP file contains plain text CSV files. Our program decompresses these files, inserts the data into a MySQL database, and continuously updates real-time statistics for each file.

Technologies Used
Visual Studio: Latest version
C#: Utilized for ETL logic
LINQ: Simplified code querying
MySQL: Database management
AI Tools: Enhanced code quality
Open Source Components: Leveraged for efficiency
Features
Data Extraction: Unzips and extracts data from CSV files.
Database Insertion: Inserts data into MySQL tables.
Real-Time Statistics: Updates statistics in real time.
Graphical Interface
Weâ€™ve also built a graphical interface to monitor the ETL process. It tracks changes in stored data, specifically the daily dollar value of transactions. The normalized database structure ensures efficient data management.

Open Source and Contribution
